black-mirror-project

This is my very first attempt to make a responsive webpage, without using Bootstrap. I started it mounths ago and however, in the school we learnt about Bootstrap, I wast to finish it, without it.
I choose Black Mirror as a theme, because I think every people should watch this magneficent show.
(Desing wasn't the most important thing in this side project.)
